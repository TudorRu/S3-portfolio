<h3>Project description</h3>
<p>
For the group project, our team has chosen to go with developing a solution for 'Info Supportâ€™ - a large company, developing mostly in the Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Technology (IT) and Software areas.
They require a software solution for their new restaurant, which will be opening at the begging of 2023, that will ease the workflow of the employees
and make it more comfortable for their clients to order, pay and overall to improve their expierience. 
This will increase the number of clients, reduce the number of misunderstood orders and make the process faster and thus enabling more orders to be made.
Guests should be able to order without interacting with a waiter in any way and also view the status of their orders in real time as they are being prepared.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

<h4>Front-end</h4>
<p>
For the front-end we initialy decided to go with Vue.js, however our front-end developer ultimately decided to go with Nuxt.js which s a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.

The framework is advertised as a "Meta-framework for universal applications". The term universal is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to enable users to create web views in JavaScript utilizing the Vue.js single file component system and that can function both as in-browser single page application (SPA) views as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) "rehydrated" to full SPA functionality. Additionally, the framework enables users to have the content, or parts of it, fully pre-rendered on the server and served in the manner of static site generators.
For my individual as you will see, I have used Vue.js and also I have helped in developing the front-end in our group project, so if I would to make a 
comparison, I can say that Nuxt.js trully makes your life easier and it's easier to understand.
</p>
<h4>Back-end</h4>
<p>
For the back-end we decided to go with .Net Core 6 because we are already familier with C# language from previous study year.
.NET (pronounced as "dot net"; previously named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.[3] It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework. The project is primarily developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation, and released under the MIT License.

<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<hr>
<p>
For the moment we didn't formulate a test plan nor made any tests for our application. The ideal way of working in my opinion is in TDD(test driven development where you first create the test, which will fail, and then implement the method that make the test to pass. This will make the refactoring and maintanance of the application a lot easier.
