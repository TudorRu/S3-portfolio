<h3>Project description</h3>
<p>
For the group project, our team has chosen to go with developing a solution for 'Info Support’ - a large company, developing mostly in the Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Technology (IT) and Software areas.
They require a software solution for their new restaurant, which will be opening at the begging of 2023, that will ease the workflow of the employees
and make it more comfortable for their clients to order, pay and overall to improve their expierience. 
This will increase the number of clients, reduce the number of misunderstood orders and make the process faster and thus enabling more orders to be made.
Guests should be able to order without interacting with a waiter in any way and also view the status of their orders in real time as they are being prepared.

<h4>Front-end</h4>
<p>
For the front-end we initialy decided to go with Vue.js, however our front-end developer ultimately decided to go with Nuxt.js which s a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.

The framework is advertised as a "Meta-framework for universal applications". The term universal is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to enable users to create web views in JavaScript utilizing the Vue.js single file component system and that can function both as in-browser single page application (SPA) views as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) "rehydrated" to full SPA functionality. Additionally, the framework enables users to have the content, or parts of it, fully pre-rendered on the server and served in the manner of static site generators.
For my individual as you will see, I have used Vue.js and also I have helped in developing the front-end in our group project, so if I would to make a 
comparison, I can say that Nuxt.js trully makes your life easier and it's easier to understand.
</p>
<h4>Back-end</h4>
<p>
For the back-end we decided to go with .Net Core 6 because we are already familier with C# language from previous study year.
.NET (pronounced as "dot net"; previously named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.[3] It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework. The project is primarily developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation, and released under the MIT License. 
</p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<hr>
<p>
For the moment we didn't formulate a test plan nor made any tests for our application. The ideal way of working in my opinion is in TDD(test driven development where you first create the test, which will fail, and then implement the method that make the test to pass. This will make the refactoring and maintanance of the application a lot easier. 
</p>
<h4>UI</h4>
<p>
To make sure that the application we envisoned matches with the expectation of our clients we have created wireframes and prototypes of all the views of the application and we have presented them to our clients in our first 2 sprints. Based on their feedback we have tweeked the wireframes once again in order to get their approval for the final version of the application.
</p>
<h3>Business Process</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  In order to showcase how the application will impact the business, I have created 2 business processes diagrams.
  
  Picture Without application
  
  Picture with application
  
  After analyzing the diagrams, we can conclude that a bottleneck can form when multiple tables want to order at the same time because one waiter will be assigned on a number of tables at the same time. This will ease the customer's ability to order and will speed up the whole process, improving the quality of service. Another issue that the application solves is the communication in kitchen and at the bar as well as between the waiters with kitchen and bar. When the products are ready to be delivered, the waiter will be notified automatically that the order is ready to be delivered.
Also, if the guests want to order again, they don't have to call the waiter and issue the order, they can simply open a new order and launch it with ease.
Finally when guests want to pay, they will simply do it by paying within the application, remove extra steps from the process.

<h3>Project description</h3>
<p>
For the individual project I have decided to develop a application which will allow users to sell their knowledge and skills and provide their expertise. A user can be either one that provides services or one that buys services. The buyer is able to chose from a large variety of categories and from the best suited provider. Other similar websites are Fiverr, Toptal, Upwork, Upteam and many more.

<h3>Technology</h3>
<h4>Front-end</h4>
<p>
In order to develope the front-end of my web application, I have went on and chose Vue.js. This decision was made because, having none to little experience with front-end, it was the same framework that we used for our group project, and I imagined that it was a good decision because if I were to get stuck at one point, I could always turn to the group project for inspiration.
Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.
Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[13] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.
Along with Vue.js, I also decided to use bootstrap in order to create my components as it will lower the time spent on manually designing all the elements of the componenets.
</p
<h4>Back-end</h4>
<p>
As well as with the group project, the best option for me was to use C# as the language for my back-end due to the fact that I am most familiar with it and it will take me less time to develop the application, unlike if I would have chosen Java.
.Net Core framework is rising in popularity and it has a big community which is willing to help and there a lot of tutorials online which can help me in writing the application with ease.
</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>At this moment the back-end solution is made out of 2 projects, first one that contains the actual api, logic and connection to the database and the second one that holds the tests. After discussing with Jean-Paul, I am planning to split the first project into multiple ones as it is best practice and it will take advantage of C# language true power in bringing multiple projects into 1 solution. It will be split into 3 separate projects: Business layer, Data Access Layer and Data Transfer Object layer.
</p>
<h4>Data persistance</h4>
<p>
For database I am using Azure MYSQL database, and in order to create my tables in the database and seed them I make use of Entity Framework Core that will greatly cut the coding time and will help me save and fetch data from my database.
</p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>
Quality assurance is the term used in both manufacturing and service industries to describe the systematic efforts taken to ensure that the product delivered to customer meet with the contractual and other agreed upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability expectations of that customer.
</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<h5>Back-end</h5>
<p>
As of now, if have decided to make unit test for my controller classes which are responsible with retrieving data from my database and issuing responses based on the results.As you can see in the below picture my current code covarage is 9.5% on 147 lines of code and I'm planning to bring that up to above 40%, and to achieve that procentage I will also need to implement integration tests to ensure my controller classes can interact with my database and make the correct calls from it, without losing or changing pieces of data. However for this I will need to setup a proper test environment which will be done later in the development. 
</p>

<p>In order to improve my code quality, I chose to use SonarCloud. This tool will scan my code after every push to the dev branch and will generate a report which will be published on the SonarCloud website. This will allow me to analyze and take in consideration which code needs to be refactored and reviewed before pushing to the main branch.Some of the features of this tools are code covarage, telling me how much of the actual code has been tested, duplicate code which will be responsible with showing me which code is repeated and how can it be refactored in such way that 0 duplication score will show and last, security review, where it will point out any exposed credentials.

Below, there are 2 screenshots, first one is an example of report of my code without tests and in the second one, you can see my code covarage going up as my
I implement unit tests.
</p>

<h5>Front-end</h5>
<p>
To test that my front-end application is working properly, I've decided to implement unit tests where I check if my routes are working properly and also that my components are generating the correct elements.
In order to achieve this, I've opted for Jest which is a popular JavaScript testing framework. A pipeline will run after a push to the dev branch will be made, which is going to run all the tests run the coverage and publish the code coverage results to Azure DevOps Pipeline.

Below you can see an example of such a report.

<h3>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</h3>  
<hr>
<p>
In order to automate testing and deployment of my back-end and front-end application, four pipelines have been created using Azure Pipelines, two for each repository.
Specific pipelines are triggered when ever pushes are being made either to dev or main branches. When a push to dev branch is being made, the tests will run and in case one or more will fail, the whole pipeline will fail, notifying the developer that push to main cannot be made.
In case the application is ready for release, a push to main will be made, which will trigger the building and deploying pipeline.

Below you can see a screenshot will the pipelines I have instated for both front-end and back-end.
Further I will explore the yaml files for all the pipelines and explain them
</p>
