<h3>Project description</h3>
<p>
For the group project, our team has chosen to go with developing a solution for 'Info Supportâ€™ - a large company, developing mostly in the Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Technology (IT) and Software areas.
They require a software solution for their new restaurant, which will be opening at the begging of 2023, that will ease the workflow of the employees
and make it more comfortable for their clients to order, pay and overall to improve their expierience. 
This will increase the number of clients, reduce the number of misunderstood orders and make the process faster and thus enabling more orders to be made.
Guests should be able to order without interacting with a waiter in any way and also view the status of their orders in real time as they are being prepared.
